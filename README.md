# Engineered-Muscle-Contractility-Analysis-Pipeline-EMCAP-v1
Welcome to the Engineered Muscle Contractility Analysis Pipeline! (EMCAP) This suite of Python scripts is designed to batch process and analyze electrical stimulation data from engineered human muscle tissues from a time force 24 well data format. The core strength of this pipeline lies in its custom, in-house peak finding algorithms.
